# Facial-Recognition-using-Siamese-Network-and-Few-Shot-Learning
This project implements a Facial Recognition System using a Siamese Neural Network enhanced with Few-Shot Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter tuning.
